---

*H*: hello everybody, welcome to round table coming to you. Live from Beijing. 

I'm HeYoung, joined by LaiMing and Neila, good as always to have you for this ride. 

We have some fascinating topics for discussion today and every day. On today's program, we're gonna talk about retirement. 

it may seem use the head for the younger people who are looking to the show. 

But, considering increased life **expectancy** and other factors. 

it's actually never too early to prepare for it. 

so how are Chinese people feeling about retirement? 

We'll get into it, and you probably already heard of private lessons for ==tentive==, swimming, or even chess. 

But what about jump roping? is jump rope training course a hoax? 

well, it actually exists, and more than a handful of people are certainly paying for it, so we'll get into it. 

And LaiMing seems to have strong feelings about it. 

**L**: it is an indicator of strong feelings. 

If, if so, yeah, I have strong feelings. 

**H**: I'm trying to read the mind of this man, but I fail every time. 

**L**: You don't have a **crystal** ball and. 

**H**: my friend, these days my crystal ball is getting ==note ever== bit more cloudy, so don't bet on it, but we'll get into it. 

We'll have a discussion about it, and I know we'll have some fun. 

And, also, I don't know what's going to come out of it, but usually it is something that is quite inspiring and makes me learn something which is one of the extra benefits we have on the show. 

you can find it on apple podcast at round table China, subscribe rate and review us, give us a five star review. Let us know what you think about the show. 

we appreciate it so much, but first on today's round table. 

a newly published report looks at how prepared Chinese people feel about retirement. 

the index said it comes up with measures, the **readiness** of retirement, and it said to the rose to 6.23 in 2020, slightly higher than the year before.

so let's take a look at what's going on here with the report that gives an indicator of people's feelings towards retirement here in China. 

**L**: Yeah, first of all, who did the research. And this is, uh a report on China's aegon retirement readiness index, and it was, will call released by the center of China insurance and risk management in Tsinghua university's school of economics and management. 

and also, Egon THTF life insurance in Beijing, and it was releasing November on November 10, 2020. 

And how do we interpret the figure, I mean the the reading 6.25 and. 

this is 6.25. 

Out of a, a of a scale from 0 to 10. 

And, 6 to 7.9 means a medium preparation index, while 8 ro 10 is a symbol of a high level of preparation. 

So if you look at it this way, then. 

yeah, Chinese people are not that, not really that prepared for retirement. 

These meeting level of preparation. 

and the report really looking to multiple uh indexes, uh including the sufficiency, every time, in preparation whatever that means. 

And there's a focus on the retirement plan, which is more specific. 

and then there's the financial planning. 

and other indexes include retirement responsibility, financial problems  

and confidence to applying, obtaining the expected income so not only specific plans, but also people's awareness. 

mental preparedness, with regard to retirement. 

actually, you think 6.23 is now not very high, but this is actually um number four across 15 countries being serve it here, and those who rank above China would be India, the USA and Brazil. 

Very, very interesting finding here, one would think that maybe the advanced economies. in the advanced economies, people were, more likely to be prepared for their retirement than those in developing countries. 

But, according to this finding uh. plenty of developing countries there are doing pretty well. 

**H**: this is definitely an interesting study. 

What, what do you think about the findings Neila. what is retirement? 

Even something you would consider. 

**N**: This is something I've been thinking about, you know, I mean, I think I think a majority of us, as. 

you know, whole see ourselves still alive in the next you know many decades to come, is something we definitely think about, because you don't. 

You want to have that comfortable life, you know, post your busy lifeï¼Œ you know.  

and, just looking at this figure, I mea, you're saying that the six point something figure is, nor is not that good or not. 

I mean, I'm assuming that's what you insinuated, but I do think it's it's actually good for an average figure for for the for the nation. 

This is fantastic because a lot of countries do not have the way below this. 

And I was just thinking on an individual basis, if this was like the average individual score, then I will probably be somewhere like 1 point something or 0 point something, you know. 

so 6.3, something is really good. 

**H**: may I ask, why do you feel you range between 0 and 1 out of ten?

**N**: I think it's, I think when it comes to sort of retirement, like what's comfortable is also a bit relative, right? 

**H**: Right

**N**: Yeah. Because for me I want to have all the luxuries I have or I dream of. when I am retired, but the fact that I'm not making as much money as I would like to be, to be able to achieve that goal. 

Then it sort of lowers my score very, very sort of gives me that very, very low score. 

But then again, I think it's all about. 

self satisfaction and what you are looking to achieve when you retire, you know, if if I want to be on a or on endless cruises and and live in a mansion on a beach somewhere in the Bahamas, then,

**H**: don't you feel differently about being on a cruise now, after the pandemic.

**N**: well, we could change that. I could switch that to buying my own boat, [07:06]

**H**: your own yachts. what is you gonna nick, what is the name gonna be? Neila?

**N**: yeah. 

**H**: So we drifted off to dreamland alone. 

**L**: A little bit.

**H**: I think that is the part, which is a little bit tricky for people when you're young. and able to bring in the monthly income, and you see yourself, possibly. going to be on a rise of salary curve, then. well, also, you know, when you're young and you feel **bulletproof**. almost like, you know, you have so many opportunities in the future. 

L: why by healthcare, why, I think about retirement.

H: exactly. 

So this is something that I don't think a lot of people would give much thought to until maybe your middle aged or a little bit older, but on round table were getting people prepared for everything, right? 

I think it also depends on what stage of life you are in and what kinds of goals you have a chip. Because each of us has a goal. 

Majority of Chinese people have sort of achieved that dream of owning some sort of property, you know, I think usually the biggest **obstacle** is funding a **permanent** home, a permanent dress. 

Once you found that, then a lot of people, then stuff. 

thinking about saving for retirement, but before you can buy yourself an apartment. 

all you're doing when you're walking. 

Yes, you're thinking about retirement, but you also think I think your priority is, how can I I need to save as much money as possible to be able to afford your own roof. 

[08:44]Yeah, and once you've achieved that, and maybe go to a car and your obvious, you feel secure, that you can't afford comfortably, even if you didn't have a job to take a child to school, then you start thinking about like, now, what about life, post retirement? 

And as to feel like a lot of Chinese will have reached that. 

I'll choose that goal of having being able to afford a ==[09:12]permanent address== for themselves. 

And now they're looking more towards saving for retirement. 

And the fact that a lot of them acknowledge that the Chinese societies, you know, the lifespan of people is, is has its really increasing people. 

living much, much longer, and definitely it's it's definitely something you have to think about. 

L: [09:29]Yeah, you don't want to live to the age of 80 and. having spent all your money already.

N: [09:36]yeah, I mean you you want to leave you be able to remember as you grow older also, that is also, you have to make sure that your medical, if you got your medically secured in terms of medical insurance, which is also expensive, the older you get. 

And also the fact that. people now, just, it's no long about, I'm gonna retire and just chill out in the village, or I'm going to retire, just chill out. home, they want to explore the world. And that also requires a lot of money. 

L: [10:04]Very interesting, yeah, Indeed, my wife and I, I think we share this before we like to plan for things. 

and like uh we make detail plans as to how we are going to get a new apartment for the purpose of raising a kid. 

and that much was pretty much done. 

and then we have occasionally giving some thoughts about our retirement life. 

but nothing setting stone yet. 

because we figure we are not there yet in terms of our age, and we're still working pretty hard on. 

improving our own worth, and making sure that we. 

continue to contribute to what we do. 

and even more, as time goes on, so the focus is more on raising the human capital. 

If that's the way to say it.

H: [10:58]If that's the fancy way to say, a child, 

L: [11:04]well, that too, but also yourself, value. 

you're worth in the society and in what you do in your career, that's sort of thing. 

And but then again, I mean, we have parents, and my parents are both retired. 

And. 

and in planning for their retirement, I think it's giving us perspective. 

I mean, we all. 

single children here, so we are looking forward to appointing. 

where our parents will be will be able to move to Beijing to live with us. 

That way, we will be able to look out for them. 

uh much more easily. 

And so there's always the issue of property. 

I mean, even though we already. 

our paying mortgage for one. 

And it's. 

when you have more family members coming in and it's going to be more. 

issues more options that you got to sort out. 

And so. 

that's where we are, and not at a point where we think of our own retirement, but that of our parents. 

H: [12:04]yeah, in property ownership is definitely something that. 

is kind of the centerpiece when you talk about what the dreams people aspire to. 

I think in this country, and also in some of the other parts of the world and in China, I think, at least for our generation. 

So those born after the 90, a. 

Born in the 1980, or even. 

a lot of people born in the 1990. 

we come from a only child family. 

And what does that mean? 

It could mean that you will almost be guaranteed to inherit the property from your parents if they own one. 

And considering how much. 

Chinese people invest in children's education and also in property than usually a lot of families do it. 

So I think that's also an interesting factor in China. 

When you look at the broader scale of things. 

that maybe home ownership is not that dire in one case, but also bear in mind, due to social mobility and just the fact that so many people can. 

like move to different parts of the country to start their lives and are doing that after the graduate from school and all that, and then comes what Laing mentioned earlier about. 

the thought of wanting to own property in a different place, and then of course, you know, that's. 

another part of the property story of our generation, and it's interesting to see, like how. 

wealth is built up and ==[13:53]==in equity is built up through property, still very much in this country. 

And another big factor when it comes to building up your financial health. 

to be ready for retirement. 

would be the future planning of how to pay the medical bill, right? 

Both of you, I think, mentioned that more or less here and there are some studies out there, but I suppose this is mainly of a vague estimation that the majority of the money we live in the bank. 

We save up in the. 

and it gets used up in the last 5 years of our lives. 

and in this country we have a medical insurance system, and there's the public. 

And of course, there's the private too. 

but for a lot of people, still, you know, being able to pay for the medical bill is. 

is not that easy, and just the thought of it adds to the pressure. 

When you think about it. 

So..

L: [14:54]well, it's never easy? 

Because on the one hand, you have your life at stake, and on the other hand, there's just money. 

And I think the the calculation is pretty straightforward and easy. 

I mean, you want to save your life. 

And in order to do that, you're willing to spend anything you have. 

H: [15:08]but it. 

I think it's more complicated in real life, actually, like some people say, what's the limit? 

And also, if you're always paying for your parents. 

medical bill, I've seen some stories of people really juggling between. 

am I A good daughter or son? 

if. 

and what if the bill is==[15:32]== to start big and you're thinking about, oh, am I able to sustain my life, and what about my children? 

and then there's also my point here is it's just complicated. 

N: [15:43 ]It is absolutely, absolutely complicated, like you mentioned, like, home ownership is not such a sort of for ==[15:50]== lack of a better description. 

A big deal for my Joseph of young people say the post, the millennial generation, for example, above. 

for majority of them, like you mention that they are almost guaranteed to sort of inherit some sort of property if their parents hard. 

Right. 

but then even if you did inherit that property, right? 

used to have when you got into your own life that your parents are aging, and you're the only child, then you've got all these pressures around you. 

So you've got your own work, pressures, you've got your own bills to pay ment mentioned you've got the minister take care of you know this, this pressure that's coming. 

in from all sort of quotas, though, it just becomes a complicated situation. 

Like. 

how much is enough for me to be comfortable in my retirement. 

What am I looking for? 

For example, if if you somebody who's looking, for example, in my country, a lot of people, an ideal retirement, means moving away from the city. 

and moving back to the countryside, where you about your own garden, you don't. 

A lot of people attend to aspire to build their house in their forties and fifties, ==[17:06]== build them. A big, nice. 

lot of lauri's house in the countryside you know, and have a big land where and where once you retire, you move from the big city, go to the contryside, live a quiet life with your neighbors. 

Do your gardening. 

feed your cows and milk them in the morning. 

Maybe go to church or go to if you're not religious person. 

and go to do volunteer work and stuff like that. 

that, but that's different, because in that case, it's not about like, for example, from my parents, travelling is not since my dad retired. 

He's never done any traveling. 

We wouldn't care less. 

He's happy the way it is. 

==[17:48]==Only when you think about like what retirement would mean to me, what I want out of free retirement, it's not that kind of lifestyle, which is more affordable. 

L: ==[17:56]==You're going to be traveling. 

N: ==[18:00]==I love to travel. 

I love to spend my my life, you know, on on the road, in the future, and also let us not forget. 

I think. 

when I'm not quite so, this report was done between one and one, 

H: ==[18:14]==it's mainly looking at the year 2020. 

L: ==[18:18]==I'm just wondering if the pandemic sort of had a sort of a role to play as well. 

It was it sort of a wake up call, particularly for the younger generation, to ==[18:18]==

H: ==[18:28]==very good point, yeah. 

Yeah, definitely. 

I think this year has just proven one fact that you gotta be saving up for a rainy day in case it happens. 

Or a pandemic, when it comes about. 

and for Chinese people, I think a lot of folks have really been relying on their savings. 

If they were, you know, if they've lost their job or would not tell, but the company is coming back, and we're seeing that. 

great growth rate projections are looking rosy that just came in, and that stuff really good news for folks who are looking for jobs and. 

possibly looking for maybe a salary bump in the near future if that happens. 

And when we talk about retirement in this country, there is another. 

and another changing factor that needs to be considered that in this country is also getting old. 

rather rapidly, so that would mean, if you look at global and international examples, that if you don't have that many people, young people, contributing to the pension fund, then in the long run that might not look so good for those who are going to be collected pension, when they reached that age. 

So this is something that we've talked a lot in China of, well, and what are your thoughts regarding ==[19:54]==, thus, I guess. at this particular time. 

L: ==[19:58]==. 

quite complicate honestly, because right now the situation is and those who are retired, they enjoy a relatively positive view to most the every time at life. 

That's because the pension from the store doing quite well. 

and even though a lot of them who are in currently enjoying pensions, they knit didn't necessarily pay for them when they were younger, because the pension system is relatively young. 

and but then uh I'm also aware of the fact that, yes, by. 

in the year 2025, we are going to have a population of those age 60 and above, reaching 300 million. 

and the percentage is the only going to be higher, so maybe we were going to have. 

some kind of pressured down the road. 

But then again. 

==[20:46]==looking at. 

the suspended and financial ipo. 

and you realize that uh. 

if it were to go ahead. 

and. 

==[20:57]==China's medical insurance founds. 

and in some other uh. 

important funds. 

will have a huge stake in this. 

so I think I see this as an example. 

of how the authorities are. 

exhausting every means. 

to increase the basket. 

both were a medical insurance found, and also maybe for pension fund. 

So we are looking for ways to to expand a cake. 

as we see the problem. 

and so, like most Chinese people. 

I tend not to worry about it in the long term, which is why this year, according to this aegon retirement readiness index. 

ironically, in light of the ==[21:43]==. 

uh we have actually scored 1.29. 

in the level cognitive, or awareness of financial planning index, which is a bit lower than last year. 

in financial planning, right, yeah. 

Awareness, cognitive level. 

the know how, and the awareness kind of criteria happened. 

N: ==[22:07]==I mean. 

if I'm assuming of correctly from wrong, because if more people knew and understood that, you know, sort of like a whale, that's all of. 

being mean the understanding how to save. 

how come that number has gone down this year? 

What happened to the other people? 

L: ==[22:27]==Which is why the numbers going up? 

I mean, you would think that Kobe would teach them a lesson to, you know, to return their awareness and also motivate them to learn more about inflation, planning in preparation for their retirement. 

But this year, according to the index, at least. 

and we are saying we are actually a lower awareness or lower level of preparedness in this regard. 

N: ==[22:49]==Ok, so it's not a low level of awareness, but rather just a low level of preparedness, because you can't be aware, like I am aware, but I'm like, very ill prepared. 

why? 

H: ==[23:02]==Okay, if you're 

N: ==[23:03]==right. 

L: ==[23:04]==something is lost in the translation, because in Chinese, so I couldn't find the Chinese text here, but a direct translation is a developing level. 

N: *[23:14]* Yeah, 

I'm imagining that a lot more people are aware about the about the importance of saving. 

of putting away money for retirement. 

but it's just a lot less. 

People are. 

less prepared, or putting away money. 

I mean, 

L: *[23:22]* I think we're going down a rabbit hole here, but essentially, the index is saying that people are less aware. 

of the urgency of saving of, 

N: *[23:42]* compared to last year 

L: *[23:43]* compared to last year. 

N: ==[23:44]== so, what happed to... 

H: *[23:47]* well, that's definitely an interesting tidbit that we can't seem to find a definite answer to, who just feel that this year, the sample pool of people that joined the survey, right? 

We're different. 

Yeah. 

L: *[24:00]* They have very small sample for. 

yeah, so well, I guess we have a little bit time for one last question here. 

That is. 

it's a tough one. 

*[24:10]* how to get people prepared? 

What should you do? 

to prepare for retirement.

**N**:[24:16] I think we need to start teaching suit. 

Children from school, right from school, because it's being prepared for retirement, also requires sort of having a habit of saving, because a lot of us say I don't have enough money to save, right? 

L: [24:28] yeah, that's a great point, I think, starting with babies, I mean, there's always more we advocate. 

H: [24:23] yeah, buying insurance plan for the baby. 

I mean, it's cheaper that way. 

you're listening Rand Table, we'll be back after the break with more roundtable discussion. 

Don't go away. 

informed opinion and heated debate. 

Find out what's got China talking and join us for your round table discussion. 

H: you're listening to round table with myself, Priya. 

Joined by Neila in my name, coming up. 

You probably heard of private lessons for tennis, swimming or even chess. 

But what about jump roping? 

And of course, you need to pay for it. 

is jump rope. 

training courses, simply. 

Ox. 

and we are going to discuss, has a smartphone usage impacted our brain, our behavior the way we think. 

will try to get to the bottom of it. 

If you're listening to our show in demand, you can find us at round table China on apple podcast. 

and also another way to participate on the show. 

please, send a voice question. 

to ez fm round table at foxmail.com. 

whatever is on your mind. 

And. 

maybe you can't be bothered to click the mouse to search it on the internet, or maybe you can't find a sufficient answer. 

We want to help you out. 

So please send that voice, question or voice memo. 

Do again, EZ FM, round table at foxville.com will give you that reply on the live show. 

And now. 

our table, as we continue our discussion. 

you may think the jump rope seems to have fallen a bit out of favor, and had become an extremely underutilized training implement. 

that is so far from reality, though there is a market for jump rope     training and jump rope boot camps are springing up like mushrooms here in China. 

I've seen that jump roping. 

is included in part of the gym training regimen, but jump roping itself as a course. 

it's something that is new to me. 

L: you haven't picked us up when you were a little kid in school, cause I remember we. 

uh being told to get one of those ropes and practised jumping when we were in primary school I mean.

H: well, don't get me wrong my friend, I know how to jump rope. 

I thought that jump rope is something that we all,

N: just comes naturally

H: yeah, but for a course to be set up to teach people to jump up. 

Is this what we're talking. 

about here

L: yes, absolutely. 

N: What is this about? 

I must have missed out something during the years when I'm out of school and not following the jump rope and trend, 

N: seeing you didn't receive any instructions while you were in a practical thing here. 

H: I don't remember being taught. 

Do you have any member of this, Nila? 

N: No, I don't know. 

I don't even remember the first time I did it because I just remember I did. 

And it was like part of our pe lessons since we were children in nursery school. 

Yeah, it was just something you picked up and you did it. 

I mean, what? 

What's so difficult about just jumping up and down? 

and, you know. adding a rock bonnet

L: it was, he was a lot of fun before kids were given smartphones and tablets in school. 

N: And also, is it okay? I'm confused here. 

like all of us, you know, could have been confused about this. 

What is actually named? is it jump roping, is it the rope jumping. 

Or. is it jumping rope?

L: I'll go with jumping rope. 

H: jumping rope? oh, that's a really good question. 

L: Because you say, passes by the same pass by as you would like to, you know.

H: ok, jump rope training course. 

N: you know, you just quite interesting how different people call it. 

And I want to like, what, what is the actual word? 

but, either way, the meaning is the same. 

L: Well, the actually is è·³ç»³

H: okay, fair and square. 

okay, well, since we ve all answered this question, more or less, let's get LaiMing in the game to um, did you ever learn how to jump rope, or was that just something you naturally sort of picked up? 

L: oh, that was. 

H: see, you can't remember either

L: that was doing primary school and I'm not sure if I received instructions as to how to do uh jumping rope, but we certainly had a lot of fun because, like I said earlier, we didn't have smells, so we didn't have an tablets. so rope jumping and and also music like classes were always the most enjoyable part of our school life. 

And yeah, so. 

to see them. 

being uh included in **tutorial**, extra **curriculum** tutorial. Suddenly, it is kind of odd. 

But **then again**, I mean, it's just like any sport. 

I mean. 

just because it's easy to do just because you **take it for granted**, doesn't mean uh people don't want to be higher, faster and stronger. 

you know?,

N: Yeah. 

I'll just about to compare it to running a marathon, somebody would say, like, why would they need somebody to train you to be a professional marathon? 

You know, it's just running. 

You can just run. 

But it's not the same. 

I think it's all about. 

if it gets to 1.8 at this person who's getting at a trainer has 0 coordination whatsoever. 

Yeah, yeah, or do they just want to to be a bit more than a bit more competitive? 

And under 1 may be improve their stamina that maybe you don't want to learn how to improve their speed. 

So they just want to learn to get the tools or to understand better the techniques of. 

maybe it uses some people can jump rope for like. 

20 minutes in a row, but I can jump for a minute and half. 

and then I'm just, I need a break, you know. 

So then in that case, i'm almost like to there. 

I cannot go beyond a minute and a half. 

And so if I need to go beyond that, maybe, and if I really, really want, and maybe I could consider getting a trainer to teach me, maybe there's something I'm doing wrong. 

L: yeah, I just feel like the whole concept of like. 

paying money for somebody to teach you to jump up and down. 

just to jump rope in itself, it is a bit ridiculous. 

Yeah, just because it's not a sport being competed at the Olympics doesn't mean people don't want to be, you know, like I said earlier. 

higher, faster and stronger, and it, 

H: yeah, but I just think this is money poorly spent. 

Sorry, some people have done there, 

N: people who have a lot of extra money they have saved for retirement travel. pay the boat, now they've got these extra money, they don't know what to do it. 

Well, if you're paying for the jupm rope training course you ain't going to save enough or your pension, that's what Im gonna say. 

L: I think I think it's better than, you know, spending a lot on tipping in your favorite personality in life. 

N: wait, wait, what? 

L: I mean, it's a bit of way of spending your money than giving a generous tip to your favorite, you know. 

N: Yeah, I mean, I don't know. 

I would love to know, because this is something I've only heard about today, about this training courses like, enlighten me. 

So some of this causes would exactly do they **entail**. 

L: eh, believe it or not, and I'm not aware. 

You know, I like most people, I take it for granted. 

I mean how hard it is to, you know, jump rope, you are getting there, you, you swing the robe, you, you jump, while the rope is about a hit your foot, and that's it. 

but I guess it's more to it than than just making sure that the rope doesn't hit your foot, I guess. 

And so one of the tricks is to not jumped to too high. You know,

H: how many, exactly centimeters should it be like me? 

L: It's been decades for me. 

But yes, so. 

the most recent experience I've had at a jumping the rope, and I, I didn't know how to do it. 

I jump pretty tall and pretty high. 

I mean, it's like like 30 or 40 centimetres above the ground, and there was obviously a very stupid, very slow. 

H: Come on, that's that's not bad LaiMing. 

I mean, whatever you do

L: the ground was shaking 

H: whatever you do, I think is amazing. 

L: It was noisy. 

H: All right. 

Okay, maybe. 

Well, if you're jumping at high, maybe you could do the ShuangYao, you know, with the double boot, then that actually takes more body coordination, because you are at risk. 

L: How do you do ShuangYao. 

H: I don't. 

I haven't done it in decade.

L: like, how it looks

H: how it looks. 

Well, double loops when you have to swing the rope really fast. 

Yeah, yeah, and yeah. 

and it takes a lot of stem when I, and also it's like using your more money and that kind of stuff, see, like I can give these this course. 

in one lesson, and then after that, I would really have to **dilute** my lesson. 

L: I think, yeah, the ShuangYao really requires a better body coordination because you have to move your arms fast, and then you have to make sure that you stay in mid-air.

H: kind of like that. 

L: helicopter

H: yeah. 

So as we do a little bit more research

L: so that's more to it.

H: yeah, actually, according to  Mr John shujun. 

he is the vice president of the jump rope association in Shanghai.
guys, let's try not to **giggle** when we're talking about this. 

Ok, give this guy the respect he deserves. 

Apparently he also runs this institution that is devoted solely to a jumping rope, yeah. 

I put that up for you guys. 

And there are 25 venues. 

and fourteen like

departments of of this institution, but they do more than jump rope class.

L: and believe it or not, the association has more than 10000 members. 

N: I'd love to meet, you know, just have a coffee with one of these members. 

It sounds very **intriguing**. 

But then again. 

we also. 

as much as it sounds funny, we also shouldn't **downplay** the importance of jumping rope. 

Was like you said, it's really, can be good for your own, you know, boosting your core strength and is not just your core strength
. 

I think it's it's better than compared to, if you went or not walking on a treadmill, just walk or on a stroll outside. 

If you want to lose your car to burn **calories** faster, the jumping rope is the way to go

H: and also a lot cheaper if you're not attending. 

a class, and you're doing it on your own

L: and you don't have to rent a space to do that, like, you're doing a soccer. 

H: Yeah, or like tennis

N: just, don't jump up and down you know in your apartment because I've done that before in my room. 

my downstairs neighbor came knocking on the door. 

just don't do it in the middle of the night, thinking people are asleep. 

L: Get a carpet

N: I had a carpet. 

L: Maybe You were doing it wrong. 

Remember you said you couldn't do it beyond 1 minute and a half I mean, so maybe you were jumping into tall and therefore the ground is also shaking.

N: or maybe just the, you known, the ceiling is just too thin, you know. 

[36:36 lost here], you've got amazing spaces out outdoor outdoor spaces where you can, just like when you go to the park for a walk or bring along your jumping rope. 

And. 

and and do some exercise in a minute or two. 

It's it's really, really helpful. 

And that's one thing I love about china. 

And like, there's so much open clean spaces where I can, just like walk around with my jump roping, and just, you know, as long as don't looks silly, you know

L: as long as you don't think about, you don't look silly at all. 

H: there was the other night, a couple of months ago, when it was still really warm outside, I came back quite late. 

I drove my car into the parking lot. 

and just as i was trying to park my car, which I do so beautifully. 

I wish people are watching. 

They're going to be like, wow, that driver is amazing. 

And hold on, she's a woman. 

She's extra amazing I guess. 

Anyway, I would **clear the name** for female drivers out there. 

Anyway, completely off topic, and my headlies were shooting. 

at this corner. 

And I. 

I was so scared for a second because I saw a person. 

jumping up and down, who's a neighbor who's jump rope jumping rope. 

and then after parked my car and I actually talked to that person was like, hey, this could be a little dangerous. 

You know, when cars come in and then. 

that neighbor was like, yeah, well, thanks for letting me know, but I'm just trying to find an open place to the space, to to to do my **routine** and not visiting the gym right now. 

Therefore, you know, this is like one of the possible replacements. 

So I guess you just find a quiet area in your neighborhood, and that shouldn't be too difficult. 

N: There are a park, like neighborhood parks everywhere. 

Yeah. 

yeah, I guess so. 

Well, any house. 

So that was a little **anecdote**. 

And another reason, actually, why can explain the popularity or the seeming popularity of the jump rope training course, is that actually this is included into the pe curriculum. 

for elementary school students, and apparently there being graded for. 

N: the technique, the skill

H: in how many Jumping rope they can do? 

yeah, how many jumps they do in a minute and that there's actually the pressure of examination sense, being tested.

N: all right, then that don't make sense? 

It's not just like people 1 day woke up and said, hello. 

That's great. 

In association with jump roping, ropes, jump, jump, jump. 

don't open at work. 

H: jump roper, I like that, I can't wait to become a jump roper. 

N: obviously that is that. 

That's that's a big reason enough to have this sort of mean should recall it. 

Sector, you know. 

take off, and obviously. 

It's. 

well, it's it's it's something that I would love to to sort of watch. 

I wish, do we have an association here in Beijing? 

But that would be like a really nice conversation to have.

L: ==[39:50]==that we know of. 

According to the news reports uh maybe we should consider moving into Shanghai. 

N: It also reminds me now this is, I'm going to go a little bit off tangent here. 

this is another game I used to see my brothers play when we were children. 

And now. 

but I see it in the past, older, some older men in the public are real. 

Open areas, spin, and then if got this long rope, and then they just like whipping some little thingy on the ground, it makes like a really loud noise if you, if you, if you didn't know there was somebody doing that, you think it's a gunshot. 

L: like a firecracker going off. 

N: what, what do you call that.

L: we call them in Chinese TuoLuo, And I know you want to have the English word for it.

N: because I remember my brother used to do, to play that, to do that, but we would never had a gay, I would never had a name for it. 

And you know, I saw it being done in the past. 

L: I think you hit it to keep it spinning. 

N: Yes. 

and it must have really loud, loud noise. 

I wonder if that exerciser two, if they have an association as well? 

L: I bet if you are interested, you can't start an association, because there are people doing that almost in every part. 

And you hear that that firecracker thing or like gunshot like a nose. 

it's almost everywhere you go

H: it might be called **gyro**. 

but I could be wrong.

N: how to spell that?

H: G Y R O,fourletters. 

I've seen they were whip thing, but I don't they're hitting something. 

Some favorite is missing something you bring with violence, but now they are having fun. 

see, I didn't know that. 

That's fascinating. 

What was not being tested or graded in school, so probably

H: not any training course for that. 

N: but I mean, jumping rope, for sure. 

I think it's amazing for anybody, if you want to. 

If you always assembly, who's always having an excuse that I don't have time to go to the gym. 

you should, you should not have that excuse because you can jump rope. 

Just thank yourself during lunch break in the morning. 

You know, it's it's amazing. 

L: Just do it downstaits.

N: you don't have to be graded for you too. 

Yeah, do it downstairs in the open, not in parking lot. 

yeah, and nerves, so many ways to keep fit. 

in a really economic way, you can do the jump rope and then do like a bit of planking, and then maybe do a few squats, squats and **crunches**. 

I do my 100 matches every night, 

L: Still doing it yet. 

H: Oh yeah well. 

For more than a decade now, and. 

N: really, every night, every single night. 

H: Yeah, did I not tell you

N: no, that's amazing. No wonder you look. 

you know, I was wondering where the 6th fuck, cause you never talk about hitting the gym that often. 

H: Yeah, I'm lazy, but I do the **regimen** that's good for myself. 

And I hope you find whatever works for you and stick with it. 

feels so good, that's the challenge. 

L: I used to be able to do this. 

N: I used to do 100. 

No, I used a 200 squats. 

oh, and then when the pandemic ==[43:12]== got lazy, I used to do 200 squats a day, 

H: no wonder you look so amazing. i noticed these things too Neila, i just didn't say anything. 

N: I know you know. 

H: you're listening to round table coming up next. 

A smartphone usage impacted our brains. 

around to find out more. 

looking for passion um how about fiery, to make 1? 

I hear about current events in China from different perspectives, then tune in to round him, meets west and understand it is legal. 

H: it's the hour of round table with myself so young, living and Neila in the studio, the internet has paved the way for the instantaneous mass dissemination of information in a **myriad** of digital forms. 

text, images, audio, video, animation, live streaming. 

The list goes on and that can all be done on one little device called the smartphone. 

A study confirmed something we probably already know, or they're suspicious about, smartphone usage and **instant gratification**, kind of go hand in hand.

L: Yeah, to use the scientific jobs. 

And we're not here to prove that one thing will lead to the other. 

What scientist is do. 

uh at the free university of Berlin is they prove that there's a **correlation**. 

between smart smartphone use and instant demand for instant gratification. 

H: well, Neila, do you feel this confirms your **assumption** at all?. 

N: I absolutely, absolutely, I was just thinking like how I **multitask** on my phone, like I will be reading something. 

And I'm like, this is boring. 

And I remember a tweet, for example, an update of a tweet. 

Or I receive an update from Xinhua about uh about something. 

I quickly forget about that, because now the other thing, you know, it's going to give me a better satisfactory is going to make me feel more entertained. 

And I think it's would smartphones have made it easier for us to. 

to have a very, very short attention spans. 

So we tend to flip flop about things. 

And even that's the same reason why I would keep **fobbing** when we're talking to people with, like scrolling through our phones, you know. 

L: because this conversation simply is not interesting, and you want some other stimulus that's more **thrilling** and **exhilarating**. 

H: Yeah, yeah, and sometimes it's almost. 

I sometimes sort of divide my attention to percentage points. 

And if this meeting, for example, I feel only **deserves** 60% of my attention than my 40% of attention will be on my smartphone or whatever. 

And in my mind, I'm like, hey, I'm also listening to you. 

yeah, and some multitasking, doing something else on my phone, but actually, in the eyes of most possibly, the person that's giving the speech, or what not would read it that way.

L: hey, not cool. 

N: No, but I think I think if you were a smart person and your uh your quote, your **moderate**. 

a meeting, for example, you're making a presentation the minute you see, because it's not just you. 

Hey yang, unless, if you just like talking to another person and then you switch to you know. 

link to your phone, but majority of meetings, if you attend, you'll see. 

in the beginning, everybody stare with her notebooks ready. 

And then just look at it, after like 5 minutes. 

you know just see nobody's doing anything. 

People are listening. 

Yeah, but people are just like down there looking at their phones, you know, just like wondering, they, some of them wondering, with a away with the pics. 

nobody there, like fully 100 percent. 

And it's also. 

and I think it's also a technique like, if you're somebody presenting or moderating the meetings, that if you recognize people are doing that, then it just means. 

it's time for either to switch to a different topic, or you're boring, or maybe, you know, try to **engage the audience further**, and stop them **monologue** and stuff like that. 

It's usually just our human brain reacted to today, just gets bored. 

H: Yet we tried to clear the name for those who with their phones. 

maybe the ipad, like I like to take my notes electronically, and so sometimes I'm actually engaged. 

N: I'm a pencil and paper person 

H: like I used to be, but I realized that I just throw my notes everywhere. 

I can't find them. 

So it's so it's almost like more efficient if I keep everything on my phone. 

But that's just ==[47:57]==,

N: but then you end up going on Facebook and weibo, and, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

H: you can also do that. 

L: I think Uh this is because the smartphone is like a portal to almost everything in your life. 

H: em, good point.

L: cause, there's something fundamentally wrong with the design of that device. 

because if you look at, you know, Amazon Kindle. 

I mean, you can't do anything except for you know shopping on amazon.com and read books, and the other digital paper that I have and by Sony. 

And they they don't even allow you to. 

to go online with a browser, this is no function there to go online. 

So. 

this way, it'll make it easier for you to focus on the one thing that you want to do, and that is reading. 

**Whereas** on a smart, uh, and this moment you get a message on Wechat. 

And then. 

the next moment, what is happening on weibo?, and then, watch the journal and the New York Times who give you the Breaking news 

N: it's also your bank in there as well. 

H: Yeah, everything. 

It's certainly takes a lot more **self-discipline** for a person to focus on 1 task. 

If they're on their smartphone. 

But what about the instant gratification part?

according to the study that LaiMing just **cited**, apparently those who use, who are **heavy users** of the smartphone, which most of us are **guilty of**. I **suppose**. 

it's apparently that the reward we enjoy is that it's small and **immediate**, and that's goes to the, you know, gratification arguement. 

N: It gives us a bite sizes of exactly what we are looking for. 

you know, and I think that's what's really, really exciting. 

And that's why we can afford to go from one page to another. 

And more task at the same time, because we know it was smart phones. 

I can still check my bank account. 

less that I can still call my mother, that night, I attend the meeting like that, I can pay for a candy and shop at the same time. 

And it's just these little bite sizes that make our lives feel complete at that particular moment. 

And it's because also we want life to move faster. 

and the smartphones are giving us, the smartphone is giving us that.

H: but the urge to want life to go faster. 

Is that what actually, naturally comes from us, or is it something that were being **conditioned** to feel? 

N: I think we've been conditioned, I think this is one of those needs that we did have, all like we didn't have it. 

we did have, but These tech companies came on, created the need for us. 

And then we just appeared from where it was hiding. 

And now it's out there. 

L: I think everybody has the wish to get instant satisfaction to some level, which is why another scientific term that came up in this research. 

is **delayed discounting**, and It's a term used to describe the phenomena where you look at offer of 100 dollars upfront and another offer of the, say, 300 dollars in 13 days, and you're gonna look at the 300 dollar offer in the

future, and you would think that there might be some kind of risks or changes involved, and therefore you gave someone a discount. 

to the offer of somewhat distant from you, as compared to one where you get 100 dollars up front. 

So I think everybody does that **calculation** to some extent, but there are people among us who are most susceptible to the feeling that delayed . 

What is the other word? discount.

yeah, so you, you are more likely to attach a greater discount to something does move **unforeseeable** in the future. 

Whereas. 

those who have a stronge self-discipline. 

they might have enough faith among themselves, and about the barking to want to hold on for a little bit longer. 

N: This is where I haven't been saving, because I'd rather trouble now, then, later, yeah

H: this is so interesting. 

The relationship between our well being. 

our thoughts and behavior. 

**versus** technology. 

And this is. 

I found this good feeling that will be another topic that will **turn up** in some shape of form. 

**regarding** this, you're listening round table and that brings us to the end of today's show. 

We have a great day. 

We will see you next time.
